<ul>
  <li> <p1 style="font-family:Starjout.ttf"> Red:
  All powerful Sith and Inquisitors use red lightsabers. The color red symbolizes power, anger, and hatred. These symbols are all part of the Sith Religion, which relies on each for their strength.
  Emperor Palpatine, Kylo Ren, Asajj Ventress, and Darth Vader all wield a red lightsaber. In the cases of Darth Vader and Count Dooku, they did not have a red lightsaber until they fully embraced the dark side, killed a Jedi, and bled their lightsaber.
  </p1>
 </li>
  <li><p2>
  Orange:
  Cal Kestis is yet another owner of a unique saber color–orange. However, other Jedi in Legends use this color of lightsaber as well. They include Yaddle, a Sith–Talak Hord, and Mandalorian Knights.
  The Mandalorian Knights are a group in Legends, once a part of the Jedi Order. They went rogue and attempted to sabotage the Republic during the Mandalorian Wars.
  Orange blades represent energy, creativity, and ambition. This meaning could explain why Talak did not have a typical red lightsaber, as he was creative and ambitious in his skill with the lightsaber. </p2>
</li>
  <li><p3>Yellow
  First seen used by the Jedi Temple Guards, the yellow lightsaber is another rarely seen color. In The Rise of Skywalker, Rey also owns a yellow lightsaber.
  Yellow represents goodness, warmth, and energy. Those who wield yellow sabers have given up a part of themselves for their position.
  In Rey’s instance, it represented her taking on the Skywalker name. While in the case of Temple Guards, they give up their identities for their positions of protection.</p3>
</li>
<li><p4> Yellow green: a mix of yellow and green </p4></li>
<li><p5>Green Lightsaber Color Meaning
Green lightsabers symbolize growth, safety, and harmony. These are yet other qualities the Jedi seek to live by–keeping others safe, growing, and working together well in the galaxy.
Unlike wielders of blue lightsabers, those wielding green ones are often very strong with the Force. Some of these Jedi include Yoda, Qui-Gon, and Luke Skywalker. They prefer fighting as a last resort, instead relying more on the Force and peaceful negotiations.
Jedi Consulars and wise, senior Jedi often have this color of a lightsaber. An example of this is Yoda, the Grand Master.</p5><li>
<li><p6>Cyan Lightsaber
In Star Wars Canon, there aren’t any cyan lightsabers. However, in Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, Cal Kestis owns one in addition to his indigo saber. Additionally, Meetra Surrik and Nikkos Tyris from Legends own one as well.
Like Darth Maul, Cal’s saber is double-bladed. The color of it represents calm and peace. Since it is between blue and green, it also stands for a Jedi who has balanced skill between the Force and combat.</p6><li>
<li><p7>A mix betwee green and bleu</p7><li>
<li><p8>Blue: Blue lightsabers are one of the colors of lightsabers wielded by famous Jedi such as Obi-Wan, Anakin Skywalker, Rey, and Ki-Adi-Mundi.
A Jedi’s purpose is to protect and bring peace to the galaxy. Those who wield blue sabers are often highly skilled in lightsaber combat.
That can be seen in The Clone Wars, as Anakin and Obi-Wan are often in the heart of battles, bravely defending the weak and fighting alongside their clone battalions.
Blue also symbolizes qualities such as loyalty, stability, truth, and justice.</p8<li>
<li><p9>Indigo
Cal Kestis is the only known Jedi to wield an indigo lightsaber. In the video game, The Fallen Order, his saber is a bluish, purple color. It is one of the many colors of sabers he owns.
This color of lightsaber represents spirituality, wisdom, and intuition.</p9><li>
<li><p10>Purple
Every Star Wars fan knows the famous holder of the purple lightsaber: Mace Windu. Samuel L. Jackson wanted to stick out in Attack of the Clones, so he asked George Lucas if he could wield a purple lightsaber.
In the High Republic Era, in Legends, Vernestra Rwoh and Ty Yorrick also owned lightsabers with purple blades. During the Old Republic, Jaina, Anakin Solo, and Darth Revan had purple lightsabers too.
Purple illustrates ambition, power, royalty, and wisdom. Mace Windu is one of the wisest Jedi on the Council, appropriately holding a saber of this color.
Additionally, purple is a mix of the colors blue and red. This mix is significant as Darth Revan went from Jedi to Sith, and back to Jedi again. It represents his switch from side to side.
<li><p12>
Yet another color found in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Legends is magenta. The Jedi and one former assassin of Emperor Palpatine who wield sabers of this color include Mara Jade and Cal Kestis.
The color falls between shades of pink and purple. Magenta sabers represent charm, harmony, and compassion></p11><li>
<li><p12>Black (Darksaber):
Similar to the white lightsabers, only one known black one is in Canon. Every other color Jedi, Inquisitors, and Sith wield. However, the Darksaber is the Mandalorians’ possession.
Created by Tarre Vizsla, the only known Mandalorian Jedi, the Darksaber passed down through generations of Mandalorians. Whoever held it could claim the throne to Mandalore.
Different from the typical lightsaber, the blade of the Darksaber was flat-shaped. The black represents power, darkness, aggression, and mystery.
In Legends, Galen Marek, the secret apprentice of Darth Vader also wields a black lightsaber. However, unlike the Darksaber, his is the typical shape of the other lightsabers.</p12><li>
<li><p13>White:
In Star Wars Canon, the only Jedi who wields a white lightsaber is Ahsoka Tano. Although she once wielded green and then blue sabers, she eventually owned white ones.
White symbolizes purity, peace, positivity, neutrality, and new beginnings. Ahsoka’s white sabers represent the path she found away from the Jedi. They show that she is neither associated with the Jedi nor the Sith.</p13><li>
